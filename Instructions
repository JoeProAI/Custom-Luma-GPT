# AI Video Generation and Shot Planning Guide

## Planning Your Video Generation

Before generating any video content, consider these key elements:
- Scene objective and emotional impact
- Required camera movements and transitions
- Lighting conditions and mood
- Duration and pacing
- Subject positioning and framing

## Fundamental Camera Shots for AI Generation

### Basic Shot Types
When describing shots for AI generation, be specific about:

**Close-Up (CU)**
- Describe exact framing of subject's face/details
- Specify emotional expression and lighting
- Include any subtle movements or focus shifts
Example: "Generate a close-up shot of the subject's face, lit from the left side, with soft golden hour lighting, focusing on their contemplative expression"

**Medium Shot**
- Define subject positioning (waist up)
- Include environmental context
- Specify subject movement and interaction
Example: "Create a medium shot of the character at their desk, framed from waist up, with warm office lighting and natural hand gestures while typing"

**Wide Shot**
- Detail all elements in the scene
- Describe depth and spatial relationships
- Include atmospheric elements
Example: "Generate a wide shot of a bustling city street at dusk, with neon signs reflecting off wet pavement, pedestrians with umbrellas moving in both directions"

### Advanced Shot Generation

**Dutch Angle**
- Specify exact tilt degree
- Describe intended psychological effect
- Include movement progression
Example: "Create a 15-degree dutch angle shot, slowly tilting further to 25 degrees as tension builds, maintaining focus on the subject's increasingly anxious expression"

**POV (Point of View)**
- Detail the perspective character's movement
- Include interaction with environment
- Describe camera shake or stabilization
Example: "Generate a POV shot from the runner's perspective, with slight camera bounce matching footsteps, passing trees and benches in a park setting"

## Camera Movements for Video Generation

### Basic Movement Instructions

**Pan**
- Specify start and end points
- Define speed and smoothness
- Include subject tracking details
Example: "Create a smooth pan from left to right across the cityscape, moving at a steady pace over 5 seconds, maintaining focus on the horizon line"

**Dolly**
- Describe track movement path
- Detail foreground/background elements
- Specify distance and timing
Example: "Generate a dolly shot moving forward through the restaurant, passing between tables, maintaining focus on the couple at the far table"

### Advanced Movement Generation

**Crane Shot**
- Define full movement arc
- Include height changes
- Specify timing and reveal elements
Example: "Create a crane shot starting at ground level, rising smoothly to 30 feet while rotating 180 degrees to reveal the mountain vista"

## Special Visual Effects and Styles

### Lighting Instructions
- Describe light sources and intensity
- Specify color temperature
- Include shadow placement
Example: "Generate the scene with dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, strong contrast between light and shadow, main light source from above right casting long shadows"

### Visual Enhancement
- Define color grading style
- Specify atmosphere and mood
- Include any special effects
Example: "Create the shot with a cool, desaturated color grade, light fog in the background, and subtle lens flare from the street lights"

## Best Practices for AI Video Generation

### Scene Planning
1. Break down complex shots into clear components
2. Describe transitions between generated segments
3. Maintain consistency in style and lighting
4. Consider processing limitations and optimize accordingly

### Quality Control
- Review generated segments for continuity
- Check lighting consistency across scenes
- Verify movement smoothness
- Ensure stable focus and framing

### Common Generation Combinations
Describe complex shots with clear, sequential instructions:
Example: "Generate a sequence starting with a crane shot rising above the crowd, transitioning to a tracking shot following the subject, ending with a dramatic push-in to close-up"

## Advanced Applications

### Scene Transitions
- Describe precise transition timing
- Include matching elements between shots
- Specify transition effects and duration

### Special Situations

**Action Sequences**
- Break down into individual movements
- Specify camera shake and stabilization
- Include impact moments and reactions

**Dialogue Scenes**
- Detail speaker framing
- Include listening reactions
- Specify timing and pacing

## Technical Specifications

### Quality Parameters
- Resolution: Specify required output quality
- Frame Rate: Define smooth motion requirements
- Stability: Describe required smoothness
- Color: Detail grading and correction needs

### Duration Guidelines
- Quick Cuts: 1-2 seconds
- Standard Shots: 3-5 seconds 
- Establishing Shots: 5-7 seconds
- Complex Movements: As needed for completion

Remember to provide clear, detailed descriptions for each shot you want to generate, focusing on both technical aspects and emotional impact.
